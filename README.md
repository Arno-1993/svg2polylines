# svg2polylines

[![CircleCI][circle-ci-badge]][circle-ci]

Convert SVG data to a list of polylines (aka polygonal chains or polygonal
paths).

This can be used e.g. for simple drawing robot that just support drawing
straight lines and liftoff / drop pen commands.

Flattening of BÃ©zier curves is done using the
[Lyon](https://github.com/nical/lyon) library.

**Note: Currently the path style is completely ignored. Only the path itself is
returned.**

This repository contains the following crate:

- `svg2polylines` contains all the functionality and can be used like a regular
  Rust library.


## Preview

There is a small preview tool to view the generated polylines. It's simple and
hacky, but helps to debug stuff.

```shell
cd svg2polylines
cargo run --release --example preview path/to/file.svg
```

The `--release` parameter is important, otherwise it's going to be very slow.

Use the mouse to drag the image and the `Esc` key to close the window.


## Usage: Rust

Signature:

```rust
fn svg2polylines::parse(&str) -> Result<Vec<Polyline>, String>;
```

See [`svg2polylines/examples/basic.rs`][example-src] for a full usage example.


## FFI

This crate used to contain FFI bindings. These have been dropped as of version
